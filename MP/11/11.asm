Exp 11: CODE CONVERSION â€“HEXADECIMAL TO DECIMAL 


AIM: 
To convert a given hexadecimal number to decimal. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Initialize the memory location to the data pointer. 
2. Increment B register. 
3. Increment accumulator by 1 and adjust it to decimal every time. 
4. Compare the given hexadecimal number with B register value. 
5. When both match, the equivalent decimal value is in A register. 
6. Store the resultant in memory location. 

RESULT: 
Thus an ALP program for conversion of hexadecimal to decimal was written andexecuted.
