Exp 13: BCD SUBTRACTION 

AIM: 
To subtract two 8 bit BCD numbers stored at consecutive memory locations. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Load the minuend and subtrahend in two registers. 
2. Initialize Borrow register to 0. 
3. Take the 100â€™s complement of the subtrahend. 
4. Add the result with the minuend which yields the result. 
5. Adjust the accumulator value to the proper BCD value using DAA instruction. Ifthere 
is a carry ignore it. 
6. If there is no carry, increment the carry register by 1 
7. Store the content of the accumulator (result)and borrow register in the specified 
memory location 

RESULT: 
Thus the 8 bit BCD numbers stored at 4500 &4501 are subtracted and the result stored at4502 
& 4503.
