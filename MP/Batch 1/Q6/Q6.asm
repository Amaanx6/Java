Exp 6: LARGEST ELEMENT IN AN ARRAY 

AIM: 
To find the largest element in an array. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Place all the elements of an array in the consecutive memory locations. 
2. Fetch the first element from the memory location and load it in the accumulator. 
3. Initialize a counter (register) with the total number of elements in an array. 
4. Decrement the counter by 1. 
5. Increment the memory pointer to point to the next element. 
6. Compare the accumulator content with the memory content (next 
element). 
7. If the accumulator content is smaller, then move the memory content 
(largest element) to the accumulator. Else continue. 
8. Decrement the counter by 1. 
9. Repeat steps 5 to 8 until the counter reaches zero 
10. Store the result (accumulator content) in the specified memory location. 

RESULT: 
Thus the largest number in the given array is found out.
