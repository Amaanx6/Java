Exp 2. 8 BIT DATA ADDITION 

AIM: 
To add two 8 bit numbers stored at consecutive memory locations. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Initialize memory pointer 
2. to data location. 
3. Get the first number from memory in accumulator. 
4. Get the second number and add it to the accumulator. 
5. Store the answer at another memory location. 

RESULT: 
Thus the 8 bit numbers stored at 4500 &4501 are added and the result stored at 4502 &4503.
