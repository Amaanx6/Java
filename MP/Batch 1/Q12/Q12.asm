Exp 12: BCD ADDITION 

AIM: 
To add two 8 bit BCD numbers stored at consecutive memory locations. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Initialize memory pointer to data location. 
2. Get the first number from memory in accumulator. 
3. Get the second number and add it to the accumulator 
4. Adjust the accumulator value to the proper BCD value using DAA instruction. 
5. Store the answer at another memory location. 

RESULT: 
Thus the 8 bit BCD numbers stored at 4500 &4501 are added and the result stored at 4502& 
4503.
