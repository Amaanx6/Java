Exp 10: CODE CONVERSION â€“DECIMAL TO HEXDECIMAL 

AIM: 
To convert a given decimal number to hexadecimal. 

ALGORITHM: 
1. Initialize the memory location to the data pointer. 
2. Increment B register. 
3. Increment accumulator by 1 and adjust it to decimal every time. 
4. Compare the given decimal number with accumulator value. 
5. When both matches , the equivalent hexadecimal value is in B register. 
6. Store the resultant in memory location. 

RESULT: 
Thus an ALP program for conversion of decimal to hexadecimal was written and 
executed.
